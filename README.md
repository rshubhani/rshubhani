# Hi, I am Shubhani 👋 
# I am a Technical Writer and a Certified Scrum Master 📝 

Welcome to My GitHub! I'm a passionate Technical Writer who thrives on learning about new documentation tools and implementing them to streamline processes. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, and I've also completed a Postgraduate program in Advanced Project Management and Strategic Leadership. 

When I'm not busy with work, you can catch me indulging in crime and horror movies for some thrilling entertainment. 🎬

# This is what I do 
I'm the go-to person for writing clear and helpful guides about tech stuff. Whether it's explaining how to use new software or updating manuals, I make sure everything makes sense. With tools like Madcap Flare, Robohelp, AdobeFramemaker, Confluence or MS_Word, I turn complicated info into easy-to-understand words.
